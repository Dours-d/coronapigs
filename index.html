          <div class="p";>In a world of a recent past, Pigs have been admiting they are not perfect enough. As new
          diseases emerged from the dump, grave decisions are to be made if Pigs want to remain free. As promising
          Organisations and Technologies came from to the Gates of salvation, benevolent and well referred Pigs had been building new politics strenght, 
          dump circulation restrictions
          plans and mandate vaccinations campains in hope to reduce the impact of the proven deadly virus.
          As the huge efforts from the population had finally came to fruition, morbid winds from <i>Est</i> are spreading fear
          and helplessness once again. But this time, no Gates will remain closed.

          <div class="p">Coming soon, in a hopeless attempt to push forward reflection and deep introspection, find the
          good ingredients and right states of mind to melt into a genetically created new enhanced CoronaPig branch to live <em>freely</em>,
          quietly in the never ending-degrading dump. CoronaPigs are those new pigs who might become the long living genetic branch
          that will save us all forever !
